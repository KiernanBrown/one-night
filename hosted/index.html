    <h1>Real Time Project 3 - Prototype 2</h1>
	<p>My goal for this project is to create an online version of One Night Ultimate Werewolf by Bezier Games, while adjusting and adding roles to make my game different. I played this game a lot with friends in my apartment last year, but since then two of them have transfered to different schools, and there has been no way of playing. Although there are other social deduction games that I have found online, nothing really replicates the fast paced and short game structure that One Night has, so I wanted to do it myself. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iIpWchKPbnlMcbsKyi5996LasQhex2LRO29MDCVmldE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click Here for a link to a design doc for this project</a></p>
    <p>This project will be created using canvas for the entire game. For this prototype players are automatically connected to a room when they join a game, and the game starts once 6 players are present. Players are all given their roles when the game starts, and then every player falls asleep. Players are woken up to take their actions as the night progresses and they are instructed of what they can do. After all the actions have been taken, every player is woken up and they have 5 minutes of time to discuss and share information. Right now, the Seer is unable to take their actionof viewing two of the unused role cards, and voting at the end of the game has not been implemented.</p>
